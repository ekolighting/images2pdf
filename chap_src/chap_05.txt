STAGECRAFT
Innovation is in ILM’s DNA. Throughout the past two decades, we have focused our R&D team on virtual production. Today, those tools & techniques are all incorporated together into ILM StageCraft, an end-to-end solution supporting all aspects of virtual production. StageCraft allows filmmakers to explore new ideas, communicate concepts, and execute shots in a collaborative and flexible production environment – the most powerful toolset we’ve ever created.
