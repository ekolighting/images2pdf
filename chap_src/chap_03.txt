CAREERS
We’re passionate about movies at ILM. Everything we do is ultimately in service of the stories we help create – whether on the big screen, streaming, or in an immersive experience. We are passionate about the art of visual storytelling.

There are a myriad of roles that come together to make these stories: Production experts, engineers, coordinators, support teams, animators, finance, accounting, supervisors, artists, editors, and more – all filmmakers. All critical roles which serve the creative projects we put on screen. 

Our clients hire ILM to make the impossible possible. We sit at the intersection of production, creativity, and technology. We seek out artists with strong technical skills and engineers with an artistic streak. In our experience, these are the people who really move the needle.

We hire to encourage diverse and rich perspectives within our ranks. Inclusiveness that represents our culture elevates our work and is also good for our business; our collaborative environments need diverse opinions to thrive.

Constant innovation is challenging. That’s why we hire people who strive for innovation over predictability and who thrive on creating the impossible. We aim to provide a great work/life balance for our employees and we monitor extra hours very carefully. This, along with our great benefits package and the incredible projects we attract, helps make ILM an exceptional place to work. 

We want to be the best studio in the world for you. If this sounds like it could be a mutual fit, we’d love for you to join our team of filmmakers here at ILM.
