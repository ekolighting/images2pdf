STAGECRAFT
Innovation is in ILM’s DNA. Throughout the past two decades, we have focused our R&D team on virtual production. Today, those tools & techniques are all incorporated together into ILM StageCraft, an end-to-end solution supporting all aspects of virtual production. StageCraft allows filmmakers to explore new ideas, communicate concepts, and execute shots in a collaborative and flexible production environment – the most powerful toolset we’ve ever created.

Available For Hire For Your Project
With 3 purpose-built StageCraft volumes located in the greater Los Angeles area, one in London, and one in Vancouver British Columbia available for hire for all types of work including feature films, series, commercials and more, our team will work with you to determine the best option for your project. For those filming elsewhere in the United State or in Europe, we can build a mobile, or pop-up, bespoke volume designed to meet your project’s specific needs when and where you need it.

StageCraft tools and workflows are driven by A-list filmmakers to meet the demanding needs of real-world shows. Our creative partners provide valuable feedback allowing for continuous improvements. We’ve sought to mold our technology to the filmmaker rather than the other way around, allowing them to work the way they are most comfortable, making the technology seamlessly integrated into a production workflow.
